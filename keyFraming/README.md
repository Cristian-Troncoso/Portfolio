### Assignemt 3

Implement a functionality that loads a character skeleton form a .skel file and displays it in 3D. All joints in the skeleton will be 3-DOF rotational joints (ball-and-socket joints) that rotate in x first, then y, then z. 
The program should perform the forward kenematics computations to generate world space matrices for the joints.
